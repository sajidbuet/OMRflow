## What is OMRFlow?

OMRFlow reads optical-mark-recognition answer sheets and turns them into
examination results. You mark up a blank sheet once to make a template, scan
the completed sheets on an ordinary document scanner, and OMRFlow aligns each
page, reads the marks, tells you what it was unsure about, matches the
scripts against your candidate list, scores them against a verified answer
key, and produces result workbooks built on your own attendance workbook.

It is a flexible, transparent, locally operated alternative to proprietary
OMR systems:

**ordinary image scanner + configurable template + transparent recognition +
human verification + reproducible result processing**

Nothing is uploaded anywhere. A project is a folder on your disk.

## Key features

- **Template designer** — registration markers, bubble grids, per-bubble
  adjustment, validation. Coordinates are normalised, so one template works
  at any scan resolution.
- **Geometric normalisation** — rotation, translation, scale, skew and
  perspective corrected to the template's canonical page before anything is
  measured.
- **Transparent recognition** — a blank, a multiple mark and an uncertain
  read are reported as what they are, never silently resolved into an answer.
- **Multicore batch processing** — one sheet per CPU worker, with identical
  results and output ordering on any number of cores.
- **Durable batches** — an interrupted run resumes without reprocessing what
  it already read. Power loss included.
- **Human resolution with an audit trail** — every correction is recorded
  append-only beside the machine's original reading, attributed to a named
  reviewer with a reason.
- **Attendance reconciliation** — unknown, duplicate and missing scripts,
  absent-with-script and present-without-script, each decided explicitly.
- **Per-set answer keys and scoring** — verification required before use,
  negative marking, defective questions, standard competition ranking.
- **Reports built on your own workbook** — your columns, fonts, merged cells
  and institution logo are preserved, because the report is a copy of your
  attendance workbook with the results written into it.
- **Examination sets** — one project can describe an examination divided into
  several question papers, carried through attendance, keys and reporting.
- **Project health, backup and recovery** — integrity checking that reports
  and never silently repairs.

## The application window

OMRFlow puts everything above your work into **one compact row**, which is
also the window's title bar:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☰  OMRFlow │ − +  ‹  1 Project › 2 Template › … › 9 Reports  ›   _  ☐  ✕ │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  the stage you are on                                                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ OMRFlow v… │ Project: …      Developed by … │ Open Source (MIT) │ ● Ready│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **One chrome row.** The application menu, the wordmark, the workflow and the
  window buttons share a single line. There is no separate header band and no
  stage heading repeating what the ribbon already says, which leaves the
  Template, Calibrate, Scan, Resolve and Reports stages close to the whole
  window to work in — including on a 1366×768 display.
- **The workflow is always one line.** All nine stages when they fit; a
  horizontally scrolling strip when they do not; and at very narrow widths the
  current stage alone, with the other eight one hover, click or keypress away
  in a selector. It never wraps onto a second row, and no stage is ever
  hidden from navigation.
- **The active stage is always visible.** However you move — a click, the
  `‹`/`›` arrows, a menu command, a keyboard shortcut — the ribbon scrolls it
  into view or becomes it.
- **`−` and `+` set how much room the workflow takes**, not how big the page
  is. They change the ribbon's padding only, within readable limits, and your
  choice is remembered in your own settings — no project file is involved.
- **The footer says which project is open**, by its examination title rather
  than its folder path, and updates the moment you create, open, rename or
  close one.
- **It still behaves like a Windows window.** Drag it by the logo or the empty
  space in the row, double-click there to maximise, resize from any edge or
  corner, and use Aero Snap, Alt+F4, Win+Up and Win+Down as usual — the window
  manager does all of that, not a hand-rolled substitute. The one thing
  framelessness costs is the system drop shadow; a hairline border stands in
  for it.

## Current release status

**`0.1.0-alpha.2`** — the current Alpha build.

| | |
|---|---|
| Release channel | **Alpha** — for evaluation and testing |
| Platform | Windows 10 1809 or newer, 64-bit |
| Installer | Unsigned; SmartScreen will warn |
| Real-data qualification | **Incomplete** |

The release channel is derived from the version string, so a build cannot
claim a maturity its version does not support.

## Download and installation

Get `OMRFlow-0.1.0-alpha.2-Setup-x64.exe` from the
**[Releases page](https://github.com/sajidbuet/OMRFlow/releases)**. No Python
required.

Verify the download against the published `SHA256SUMS.txt` — the installer is
unsigned, so the checksum is how you confirm you have the file that was
built:

```powershell
certutil -hashfile OMRFlow-0.1.0-alpha.2-Setup-x64.exe SHA256
```

Full instructions, including the SmartScreen warning and where your data
lives: **[Installation](docs/wiki/Installation.md)**.

## Quick start

**[Quick Start](docs/wiki/Quick-Start.md)** walks the whole workflow in about
half an hour using **synthetic data OMRFlow generates itself** — so you can
see what it does without needing real answer sheets:

create a project → open the example template → generate synthetic sheets →
process them → resolve what recognition flagged → import a candidate list →
enter an answer key → score → generate reports.

## Development status

**Current release: `0.1.0-alpha.2`**

Phases 0–10 are implemented; Phase 11 takes OMRFlow from "implemented and
synthetically tested" to a qualified stable release.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 0–2 — Foundation, geometry, template designer | **Complete** |
| 3–9 — Recognition, calibration, batch, conflicts, attendance, scoring, reporting | Implemented; synthetic testing complete, real-data testing in progress |
| 3/6 addendum — scan-quality (page-geometry) detection | Implemented; **under testing** — synthetic and real-scan validation done, wider real-batch validation pending |
| 10 — Integration, recovery, production hardening | Implemented; 100,000-sheet acceptance run pending |
| **11A — Alpha release infrastructure** | **Implemented — validation pending**; release automation complete and tested, clean-machine test run and passed, its manual steps outstanding |
| 11B — Real-data qualification & Beta | Pending |
| 11C — Release candidate & stable | Pending |

### Testing status

| | |
|---|---|
| Automated suite | 4,659 tests passing (3 skipped: no LibreOffice, no desktop window manager), plus `ruff` and `mypy` |
| Cross-platform CI | 🟠 Tests and packaging green on Windows and Ubuntu ([run 36210285696](https://github.com/sajidbuet/OMRFlow/actions/runs/36210285696), 2026-09-26); the lint/type gate was red from 2026-09-25, when SQLAlchemy 2.1 respelled a query annotation — corrected, awaiting a confirming run |
| Synthetic end-to-end | ✅ Passing, from source |
| Synthetic qualification data | ✅ Template-driven scans **and** set-specific attendance workbooks with deliberate reconciliation conflicts and exact ground truth — see [Synthetic datasets](docs/testing/SYNTHETIC_DATA.md) |
| Synthetic marks on real paper | 🟠 **Implemented — automated tests passing, real-paper smoke test pending.** Marks drawn onto a scan of a real blank form, registered through the production alignment pipeline, in colour / grayscale / black-and-white; attendance and reconciliation generation are unaffected by the choice of mode. Automated coverage passes, including registration measured against known homographies (worst case 0.33 px at the bubble centres) and the recognition engine reading generated sheets exactly as labelled. Exercised against *rendered stand-in* blank scans only — **no genuine scanned sheet has been through it yet**; the [procedure](docs/testing/SYNTHETIC_DATA.md) is written and waiting. The marks themselves remain synthetic in both modes |
| Physical corner folds | 🟠 **Implemented — targeted tests passing, full suite not yet re-run.** Micro / small / moderate / severe folds at any of the four corners, in both rendering modes, applied to the composed sheet so paper, printing and marks fold together. Marker interaction is computed from the template's actual marker polygons — per-marker overlap fractions, including the orientation mark — and an interaction the geometry cannot produce is reported as not applicable rather than faked. Off by default, and a disabled policy is byte-identical to a run from before folds existed. 236 new automated tests pass; see [Synthetic datasets](docs/testing/SYNTHETIC_DATA.md) |
| Packaged application | ✅ Launches, navigates and closes cleanly under UI Automation |
| Installer | ✅ Install → launch → uninstall → **user data preserved** → reinstall |
| Clean machine | ✅ 56/56 automated checks on a pristine Windows image; its manual steps outstanding |
| Accessibility | 🟠 Automated checks pass; 8 controls have no accessible name (recorded, non-blocking at Alpha) |
| Real examination data | ❌ **Not started** — this is Phase 11B |
| 100,000-sheet qualification | ⚪ Harness ready, not run |
| Release automation | ✅ One command prepares a release; GitHub Actions builds and publishes it. 96 tests, no step needs a person or a model — see [Release Checklist](docs/release/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) |
| Template Editor interaction | ✅ Debugging pass completed — see below |
| Real-scan registration | 🟠 First real scanned cohort registered and calibrated — 8 sheets, one template. See below |
| Calibration workspace | ✅ Reorganised around the scan preview — see below |
| Project template | ✅ The template is now project state, chosen once and shared by Template, Calibrate and Scan — see below |
| Conflict-resolution semantics | ✅ Updated — Resolve now covers student ID / roll and set code only; ambiguous answers stay in the recognition result. See below |
| Scan-quality / page geometry | 🟠 **Implemented — under testing.** Detects a physically folded, curled or lifted sheet that registers cleanly but whose printing has moved. Validated on synthetic lattices, the committed sample sheet and two real scans; see [Scan quality](docs/scan_quality.md) |

#### Conflict resolution is for identity, not for answers

Conflict Resolution used to receive every value recognition could not decide,
including answers. An examination of a hundred questions could therefore stage
a hundred conflicts per sheet, and the one or two that genuinely stopped a
script being attributed were impossible to find in them. Worse, ambiguity no
human decision could improve — a candidate who filled two bubbles filled two
bubbles — blocked the batch from going on.

The **Resolve** stage now holds only ambiguity that leaves the *record*
unusable:

```text
recognition result
     |
     +-- student ID ambiguity ----> conflict
     +-- set code ambiguity ------> conflict
     +-- sheet unreadable --------> conflict
     |
     +-- answer ambiguity --------> answer result only
```

An ambiguous or multiply-marked **answer is not a conflict**. Everything the
engine measured about it is kept — the status, the fill ratios, `needs_review`,
the value — and it exports exactly as before: `B`, `B-D` for a double mark, `?`
or `B?` for a read too faint or too close to call, empty for a blank. Nothing
is discarded and no answer is resolved algorithmically.

Consequences, all of which are covered by tests:

- **Counts mean something again.** A batch with 100 ambiguous answers, 2
  disputed student IDs and 1 disputed set code reports **3** unresolved
  conflicts, not 103 — on the Scan page badge, in the Resolve summary, in the
  export's `unresolved_conflicts` column and in the project health check.
- **Answer ambiguity no longer blocks.** A batch whose only ambiguity is in its
  answers passes the conflict-resolution step with zero items.
- **Scoring does not silently gain an answer.** A question the engine could not
  reduce to one option is marked as a multiple (`?`), never as the option it
  nearly said and never as a blank, so removing the block did not turn a doubt
  into a mark. An unresolved **set code** still blocks: marking a script against
  the wrong paper's key is the worst available outcome.
- **Older projects open unchanged.** A project scanned before this change keeps
  its stored answer conflicts — they are evidence, and a decision somebody
  recorded on one is still honoured in exports and scoring — but they no longer
  appear in the queue or in any count, and a re-read withdraws the untouched
  ones. Nothing is rewritten on load.

The distinction is enforced where conflicts are *created*, not hidden in the
GUI: `ConflictType.requires_resolution` and `FieldKind.is_record_identity` in
`domain/review.py`, read by `services/conflict_policy.py` and by one SQL filter
in `services/review_store.py`. See
[Conflict detection and human review](docs/conflict_review.md).

**Testing.** 39 Resolve-stage GUI tests, 35 end-to-end conflict-review tests,
53 review-store tests, 40 detection-policy tests and 12 new tests for the
scoring guard, all run. The whole suite (4,659 tests), `ruff`, `mypy` and the
55-check Qt GUI smoke run were re-run green — the smoke run includes a new
check that a sheet carrying both a bad roll-number column and a double-marked
answer stages only the roll number. Real examination data remains Phase 11B.

#### One template per project

The template used to be three independent copies of a path — one held by the
Template screen, one by Calibrate, one by Scan — so the same `.omrt` file had
to be browsed for three times, and nothing stopped the three from disagreeing.

A project now records its template in `project.json`, as a **project-relative**
POSIX path (`templates/OMR-Scan.omrt`), so copying the project folder onto a
memory stick or a marking machine carries the choice with it. `project.json`
moves to format version 3; the field is optional, and a project written before
it existed opens unchanged.

Which template a project uses is decided in one place, when the project opens:

| The project… | What happens |
|---|---|
| names a template that exists | it is used, on all three screens |
| names a template that has gone | the project still opens; Calibrate says so and asks for a replacement |
| names none and owns exactly one | that one is adopted, and written down |
| names none and owns several | nothing is guessed — picking wrong would read the sheets against the wrong geometry and still look plausible |
| names none and owns none | the screens are empty, as before |

Saving a template, or opening one of the project's own templates, on the
Template screen makes it the project's template: the page tells the main
window, which records it and re-broadcasts the session, so Calibrate and Scan
learn about it exactly as they learn about a project being opened. A template
from outside the project is opened for viewing and adopted by nothing.
Switching projects swaps the template on every screen, and a project with no
template clears what the previous one left behind. File dialogs on these
screens now open inside the project rather than at the home directory.

**Testing.** 30 tests, all run: 20 against real project directories on disk,
10 driving a real main window through open, save, switch and delete. Two
defects the tests found — Scan keeping the previous project's template, and
Calibrate's "template missing" notice being overwritten by the label refresh —
were fixed and are covered.

#### Calibration workspace reorganised

The Calibration stage now gives its height to the thing it is about. A
ten-line status paragraph and an always-open results table used to sit
permanently beneath the registered page; with a real result loaded the preview
held **57%** of the workspace (547 px at 1920×1080) and the paragraph alone
took 140 px of it.

| | Before | After (drawer shut) | After (drawer open) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Preview, 1920×1080 | 547 px · 57% | **832 px · 87%** | 680 px · 71% |
| Preview, 1366×768 | — | 499 px · 77% | 347 px · 54% |

The split is decided by **stretch factors**, not fixed pixel heights, so the
preview grows with the window and reclaims the drawer's space when it is shut.
The status paragraph became a single wrapped row of labelled chips —
`✓ Registration 4/4 · ✓ Orientation · ID … · 69 marked · ⚠ 31 review` — each
carrying words as well as colour. Four sections now fold, all shut by default
and each showing a one-line summary on its own header: **Sample results**,
**Selected scan details**, **Recognition thresholds**, **Field diagnostics**.

Nothing was deleted. The response-position counts, near-threshold count and
unusable-window count are the body of *Selected scan details*; the per-question
list is in *Field diagnostics*, scrolled rather than stacked.

**Engine untouched.** No file under `imaging/`, `recognition/` or the
calibration service's scoring was modified by this pass.

**Testing.** 28 new layout tests plus the existing 90 calibration tests, all
run. Each of four layout guarantees was verified load-bearing by reverting it
and confirming its test fails. Screenshots captured at 1920×1080, 1600×900 and
1366×768 across the empty, passed, failed, drawer-open, thresholds-open and
diagnostics-open states, and inspected. The page was **not** driven by hand
through a live calibration run.

#### Real-scan registration debugging

A real project — a real `.omrt` template and eight real scanned sheets — failed
calibration with *"the orientation mark ... was not found"*. The mark was
present, black, and exactly where the template said.

**Root cause.** The orientation confidence was `fill / (1 / window_margin²)`,
which assumes the template's declared orientation box tightly bounds the
printed mark. Nothing enforces that, and the designer lets the box be drawn
with margin — which is the natural way to draw one. This template's box was
about twice the mark in each axis, so the ink was diluted over four times the
area: the correct orientation scored **0.29** against a 0.35 floor, and sat
only **0.01** ahead of its own 180° twin, because a window mostly full of
paper scores much the same wherever it is placed.

**Fix.** The mark is now scored over the best of several concentric windows,
so the measurement no longer depends on how tightly the box was drawn. A
template whose box already fits is unaffected. On the real sheets confidence
went from 0.29 to **1.00** and the margin from 0.00 to **0.63–0.73**.

The four registration markers were never the problem — they were detected all
along, at scores 0.93–0.95. The calibration panel reported *"Markers detected:
0 / 4"* purely because the failure path never recorded what the engine had
found, which sent the investigation after a detector fault that did not exist.
It now says *"not reached"* rather than asserting a count it never measured.

**Verified on the real dataset:** 8/8 sheets register, resolve orientation and
sample all 500 bubble positions, with 0.0 px reprojection error. Bubble
overlays were inspected visually against the printed sheet and are concentric
with the printed bubbles. The scans themselves are examination material and
are not in this repository; the regression tests are synthetic.

#### Template Editor interaction pass

Five interaction defects, all of the same shape — the editor knew the right
answer but did not show it until some later event:

| Defect | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Spin-box arrows showed an I-beam and clicking them put the caret in the text | Styling a spin box switches it to `QStyleSheetStyle`, which lays the line edit across the whole padded rect unless the up/down buttons declare a width. They did not, so `childAt()` over an arrow returned the `QLineEdit` — the editor was physically on top of the buttons | Explicit `::up-button` / `::down-button` geometry in the central stylesheet, so the editor stops short of them. Hit-testing, not appearance; Qt's auto-repeat, keyboard stepping and typing are untouched |
| Editing X/Y/W/H in the inspector did not move the canvas | The panel emitted only on `editingFinished`, i.e. on Enter or focus loss | A separate `geometry_preview` signal on `valueChanged` redraws immediately; `geometry_edited` still commits once, so there is no undo entry per keystroke |
| Bubbles did not follow a region being dragged or resized | The mid-drag handler updated the inspector numbers and nothing else; bubbles were recalculated only on release | The same handler now re-fits the layout with `resize_zone` — the *same* pure function the commit path uses, so preview and result are identical and releasing produces no jump |
| Default bubble radius | `DEFAULT_BUBBLE_RADIUS` was the same constant as the legacy fallback for templates predating the field | Split them. New templates get **20 px**, converted per page; the fallback stays where it was, so existing templates keep the geometry they were drawn with |
| Cursor stayed a hand while drawing a region | Three code paths fought: a crosshair on the view, `ScrollHandDrag` putting an open hand on the *viewport*, and `_stop_pan` calling `unsetCursor()` unconditionally | One `_apply_cursor()` derives the cursor from the mode and sets it on the viewport |

Both directions of geometry editing are now synchronised: a canvas drag
updates the inspector and its normalised values, and an inspector edit updates
the canvas, the bubble layout and the normalised values.

**Testing status.** 55 focused tests were added and run. Each of the five
fixes was verified load-bearing by reverting it and confirming its test fails.
The spin-box tests are **skipped on the offscreen platform** — the defect is an
interaction with the *Windows* style, and on Fusion they pass whether or not
the fix is present, so they run on a Windows desktop and report a skip in
headless CI rather than false assurance. Manual GUI walkthroughs (TEST A–F)
have **not** been performed.

#### Cross-platform CI defects fixed

Four Ubuntu-only failures, all of them the suite correctly reporting a genuine
platform difference rather than flakiness:

| Defect | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `mypy` reported an unreachable statement in `services/process_containment.py` | The Windows path sat behind an early `return` rather than a `sys.platform` *block*; mypy exempts platform-guarded branch bodies from `--warn-unreachable`, but not code following an early return | Restructured into `if sys.platform == "win32": … else: …`. No `type: ignore`, no change to the mypy configuration |
| Workflow labels elided in layouts chosen *because* the labels fit | `QFontMetrics.horizontalAdvance` sums glyph advances, `elidedText` lays the text out; they disagree by up to a pixel of right bearing, so a step drawn at exactly its measured width elides | One pixel of measured headroom per step (`ELISION_SLACK`), plus a test that pins the invariant at the exact boundary |
| The kill/resume test asserted that workers die with the coordinator | That is a Windows Job Object guarantee; `process_containment` documents that no POSIX equivalent is implemented | The Windows guarantee is still asserted on Windows; every other property is still asserted everywhere; surviving workers are reaped so no run leaks processes |
| A synthetic-dataset test compared ink over a fixed percentage crop of the raw page | Two causes. The sheet it measured was picked from an unsorted `glob`, so a different filesystem chose a different candidate — and a different candidate has a different number of marked bubbles, which *is* the measurement. The crop itself was also meaningless: a rendered sheet is not in canonical coordinates, since it carries a scan margin and the geometry cases rotate and crop it, so the rectangle covered whatever happened to fall in it | The scan is rectified with `align_sheet` and its bubbles measured with `measure_bubbles` — the same pair recognition uses — and the representative sheet comes from a sorted listing. Compared on `fill_ratio`, which is normalised against levels read from the image itself. A second test now also pins that a blank identifier renders *no* marked bubble at all |

The first three were verified locally with `mypy --platform linux` and the GUI
suite under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, and then **confirmed green on the
Ubuntu runner itself** in
[run 35809212682](https://github.com/sajidbuet/OMRFlow/actions/runs/35809212682).
The fourth was found by the Ubuntu runner afterwards, in
[run 35959715301](https://github.com/sajidbuet/OMRFlow/actions/runs/35959715301),
and is fixed in this release.

### Release qualification infrastructure

Release qualification is a local, unattended framework — one command, a
machine-readable report, a meaningful exit code, and no supervision:

```powershell
python tools\release_validation\validate_release.py --safe   # no install/uninstall
python tools\release_validation\validate_release.py --all    # including the installer
```

It covers source tests, Qt GUI behaviour, accessibility, an end-to-end workflow
smoke test, the built bundle, the **packaged executable**, and the installer
round trip. See
**[`tools/release_validation/README.md`](tools/release_validation/README.md)**.

Current qualification focus:

- real examination datasets and real scanner output;
- real attendance workbooks;
- set-specific end-to-end validation;
- the clean-machine steps that need a person;
- a green Ubuntu CI run **for this release**: the Ubuntu runner has been green
  since the first three cross-platform defects were fixed, but the fourth was
  found after that and its fix has been verified only on Windows so far.

**Implemented, automated tests passing, synthetic dataset validated, real
scanned dataset validated and production validated are five different
things, and OMRFlow currently claims the first three.**

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read
**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** first — in particular the parts about
tests, database migrations, and never committing real candidate data.

- **Report a problem:** [open an issue](https://github.com/sajidbuet/OMRFlow/issues/new/choose),
  after reading [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) on how to sanitise a reproduction.
- **Security or privacy:** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — **not** a public
  issue.

> **OMRFlow processes examination material.** Never attach real candidate
> names, roll numbers, rosters, answer keys, scans or project folders to a
> public issue. OMRFlow can generate synthetic sheets — and synthetic
> attendance workbooks — for exactly this purpose:
> *Tools → Developer / Testing → Generate Synthetic Test Dataset…*

## Privacy

OMRFlow has **no telemetry, no analytics and no network access** during
examination processing. Everything stays in the project folder on your disk.
Treat that folder as confidential examination material — see
[Backup & Data Retention](docs/wiki/Backup-and-Data-Retention.md).

## Citation

If you use OMRFlow in research, teaching, academic work, software, or another
project, please cite the software. Citation helps others discover the project
and supports continued development.

**DOI:** <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22943575>

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1371137095.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22943575)

Every release is archived on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22943575).
The DOI above is the *concept* DOI: it represents OMRFlow as a project and
always resolves to the most recent archived release, so it stays correct as new
versions appear. Each individual release also receives its own DOI, listed on
the Zenodo record, for when you need to point at one exact version.

GitHub's **Cite this repository** button, on the right of the repository page,
reads [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) and will generate these for you.
