"""Generating a dataset without freezing the window.

Purpose:
    Run :func:`~omr_scanner.evaluation.synthetic_dataset.generate_dataset` on a
    worker thread and report its progress as Qt signals.

Responsibilities:
    * :class:`DatasetWorker` - one run, cancellable, reporting counts.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Any decision about *what* to generate; the worker is handed a request.
    * Any widget. The worker emits; the dialog draws.

Why a thread and not a process:
    Rendering is one page at a time and spends its life in OpenCV, which
    releases the GIL, so a thread keeps the window responsive without the
    pickling and start-up cost a pool would add. The batch *recognition* path
    uses processes for the opposite reason - it is CPU-bound Python.

Progress and ETA:
    Reuses :class:`~omr_scanner.services.BatchProgressTracker`, the same
    estimator the Scan page's progress panel uses. One smoothing rule, one
    warm-up rule, one definition of "remaining", so the two screens cannot
    disagree about how long something will take.
