"""Asking what synthetic dataset to generate.

Purpose:
    Collect the handful of decisions that define a dataset - template, where to
    put it, how many sheets, which profile, which format, which seed - and hand
    them back as one plain object.

Responsibilities:
    * The form, its defaults and its validation.
    * :class:`GenerationRequest`, which is what the rest of the feature works
      from.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Generating anything, or knowing how. The dialog does not import the
      renderer; it reports a request, and
      :mod:`~omr_scanner.gui.devtools.generate_worker` carries it out.

Why the template is a file rather than "the loaded one":
    A dataset is generated *for* a template and must be benchmarked against the
    same one. Naming the file, and recording it in the manifest, is what makes
    a dataset traceable three months later; borrowing whatever happened to be
    loaded would produce datasets nobody can attribute.

Why the reference scan is not remembered between runs:
    It is an input to *this* job, like the template and the output folder, and
    the dialog treats it as one. Persisting it would mean introducing a
    preference store this application does not have, to remember a path whose
    usefulness expires with the run. The Browse button opens on the current
    project's folder instead, which is where a scanned blank form is kept.

Why the dialog cannot tell you the scan is unusable before you press Generate:
    Checking would mean registering it, which is an imaging operation, and this
    layer must not import ``cv2``, ``numpy`` or ``omr_scanner.imaging`` (see
    ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` and ``tests/unit/test_architecture.py``). So the
    dialog checks that a file was chosen and exists, and the worker reports the
    registration failure - which it does before writing a single sheet, so the
    answer still arrives immediately rather than after a long run.
