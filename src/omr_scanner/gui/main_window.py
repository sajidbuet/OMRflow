"""The application main window.

Purpose:
    Assemble the application shell, own the project lifecycle from the user
    interface side, and route menu commands to services.

Responsibilities:
    * Assemble the shell: one chrome row, the stacked pages, the status
      footer and the status bar. Three bands, and the first of them is also
      the title bar.
    * Own the File/Tools/Help action hierarchy, and hand it to the chrome
      row's menu button.
    * Own the *window*: it is frameless, so minimising, maximising, restoring,
      closing, moving and resizing are this class's responsibility rather than
      the platform's - see "Why the window is frameless" below.
    * Hold the single open :class:`~omr_scanner.services.ProjectSession` and
      broadcast changes to every page and to the footer.
    * Keep the recent-project list in the application configuration up to
      date, and keep the Project dashboard's copy of it in step.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Any project/database/imaging logic. Every action delegates to
      :mod:`omr_scanner.services`.
    * Long-running work. Batch processing runs in a worker thread and reports
      progress through signals; the main window must never block.
    * Styling, painting and responsive arithmetic. Each shell part is a widget
      in :mod:`omr_scanner.gui.widgets` that decides its own layout from its
      own width, so this module contains no geometry and no colours.

Testability:
    Commands are split in two: ``_prompt_*`` methods own the modal dialogs,
    and :meth:`create_project_at` / :meth:`open_project_at` /
    :meth:`close_project` contain the behaviour. GUI tests drive the second
    group, so no test has to interact with a native file dialog.

Why the menu bar is hidden rather than removed:
    The reference design replaces the permanent File / Tools / Help row with
    one menu button, but the *actions* must keep working exactly as they did,
    shortcuts included. The three menus are therefore still built on
    ``menuBar()`` - which keeps the hierarchy, the nesting and Qt's own
    shortcut context intact - the bar itself is hidden, and the chrome row's
    menu button pops up those same `QMenu` objects as submenus. There is one
    File menu in the application, and nothing is duplicated or reimplemented.

Why the window is frameless:
    The shell now draws its own title bar, because merging it with the
    workflow ribbon is what removed a whole 48-pixel band from the top of
    every stage. That is only worth doing if the window still behaves like a
    Windows window afterwards, so nothing here re-implements what the platform
    already does:

    * Moving is ``QWindow.startSystemMove()``, from the chrome row. The window
      manager performs the drag, which is what keeps Aero Snap, snap-to-edge,
      drag-to-top-to-maximise and cross-monitor DPI handling working.
    * Resizing is ``QWindow.startSystemResize()`` from
      :data:`WINDOW_RESIZE_BORDER` pixels of frame around the central widget -
      again the window manager's own resize, with its own snapping and its own
      cursors, rather than a hand-rolled ``setGeometry`` loop.
    * Minimise, maximise, restore and close call ``showMinimized()``,
      ``showMaximized()``, ``showNormal()`` and ``close()``. Maximised
      geometry, multi-monitor placement, the taskbar entry, Alt+F4, Win+Up,
      Win+Down and system activation are all untouched, because none of them
      was ever the frame's doing.

    One thing is genuinely lost and is not worked around: Windows draws no
    drop shadow around a frameless window. Restoring it means either a DWM
    call or a translucent parent widget, both of which are the brittle
    platform hack the brief rules out; a hairline border stands in for it
    instead. See ``docs/wiki/Developer-Architecture.md``.
