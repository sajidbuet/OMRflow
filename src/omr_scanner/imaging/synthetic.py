"""Synthetic OMR sheets and controlled distortions of them.

Purpose:
    Make alignment accuracy a *measured number* rather than an opinion. A sheet
    rendered from a known specification and then distorted by a known homography
    has ground truth attached: every claim about how well the engine recovered
    the page can be checked against it.

Responsibilities:
    * Render a canonical page carrying four registration markers, an orientation
      mark, interior control points and realistic competing graphics.
    * Apply reproducible translation, scale, rotation, perspective, brightness,
      blur, noise and JPEG degradation, returning the exact homography applied.

Why the interior control points matter:
    The homography is fitted through the four marker centres, so those four
    points map onto their targets to numerical precision no matter how wrong the
    detection was. Reprojection error over them therefore measures arithmetic,
    not geometry. The control points are *not* used in the fit, so the distance
    between where one of them ends up and where it should be is an honest
    measure of how much of the page was actually recovered.

Why the competing graphics matter:
    A sheet that is white paper plus four black squares makes any detector look
    good. These pages also carry hollow answer boxes the same size as a marker,
    rings of unfilled bubbles, text-like bars and optional solid decoy squares
    placed inside the corner search regions, because those are the shapes that
    defeat a detector relying on outline alone.

Marked bubbles (Phase 3):
    :attr:`SyntheticSheetSpec.answer_bubbles` renders bubbles at *given*
    positions, optionally shaded and optionally with a symbol printed inside the
    ring - the arrangement a real sheet uses, and the one that makes an empty
    bubble contain ink. That is what lets a recognition test state its ground
    truth ("Q7 is b, Q8 is blank, Q9 is b and d") and check it, with the same
    controlled distortions the geometry tests already use.

    The positions are plain normalised coordinates, not a template: this module
    must not know that ``.omrt`` documents exist (``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md``).
    Deriving the positions from a template is the caller's job - the test
    fixtures in ``tests/conftest.py`` do it.

The mark layer, and why it is a separate render:
    :func:`render_mark_layer` draws the candidate's ink *and nothing else* -
    no registration markers, no bubble rings, no printed option letters, no
    decoy graphics. It exists so that a sheet can be produced by compositing
    those marks onto a photograph of a real blank form instead of onto a page
    this module drew, which is the only way a generated dataset carries real
    paper texture, real print and real scanner behaviour under known answers.

    It deliberately shares :func:`_draw_mark` with the full render rather than
    reimplementing the shapes. A second copy of the mark geometry would drift,
    and a dataset whose two rendering modes disagreed about where ``fill=0.35``
    puts ink would make the two modes' results incomparable - which is the one
    thing a second mode must not cost.

Colour:
    Everything here draws in grayscale, because a printed OMR sheet carries no
    colour information to invent. :class:`ColorMode` and its two helpers exist
    for the *output* stage: see that class's docstring for why a colour choice
    has to be applied in two places rather than one.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Any knowledge of templates, fields or answers. This module draws circles
      where it is told to.
    * File I/O.

Status:
    A development and test utility. It is shipped inside the package rather than
    under ``tests/`` so that the developer tools in ``omr_scanner.tools`` can
    produce a sheet to work on without an external fixture.

            make every measurement either 0 or 1 depending on which side of the

            a measurement test that omits it is testing an easier problem than
            the real one.
        style: How the mark was made; see :class:`MarkStyle`. Every style other

    The distortion :class:`DistortionSpec` cannot express, and the only kind
    worth testing a page-geometry check against. Every field of
    ``DistortionSpec`` is projective or photometric, which means a homography
    can undo it exactly - so a sheet distorted that way *should* pass a geometry
    check, and using one as a positive test would only prove the check was
    broken. A physically curled, folded or lifted page is not a plane at all,
    and no homography can undo it; that is what this reproduces.

    Modelled as a Gaussian displacement bump, which is what a corner lifting off
    a platen actually does to the image: maximal where the paper is furthest
    from the glass, falling away smoothly, and zero where the sheet still lies
    flat.

    Attributes:
        center_x: Centre of the deformation, normalised to page width.
        center_y: The same, to page height.
        radius: Standard deviation of the bump, as a fraction of the page.
            Roughly "how much of the sheet lifted".
        amplitude_px: Peak displacement in pixels, at the centre of the bump.
        direction_x: Horizontal component of the displacement direction.
        direction_y: Vertical component. The vector need not be normalised; its
            length scales ``amplitude_px``.
        edge_margin: Fraction of the page over which the deformation is faded
            out to zero at the borders. This is what keeps the **registration
            markers** where they were, which is the entire point of the test: a

            never reach the geometry check. The hard case - the one this models
