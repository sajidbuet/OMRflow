"""Low-level image processing: geometry now, bubble metrics from Phase 3.

Purpose:
    Everything that operates on pixels: preprocessing, registration-marker
    detection, orientation determination, corner ordering, perspective
    transformation, scale normalisation, thresholding and (later) bubble
    metrics.

Modules:
    * ``models.py``           - the pipeline's typed vocabulary.
    * ``config.py``           - every tunable number, named and documented.
    * ``preprocessing.py``    - validation, grayscale, downscale, threshold.
    * ``marker_detection.py`` - candidate measurement, filtering, corner choice.
    * ``orientation.py``      - which corner of the scan is the sheet's top-left.
    * ``orientation_marker.py`` - where the orientation mark is inside a region
      the designer's user drew around it.
    * ``geometry.py``         - point ordering, quadrilateral checks, homography.
    * ``alignment.py``        - the orchestrator; :func:`align_sheet`.
    * ``diagnostics.py``      - optional overlays and textual reports.
    * ``synthetic.py``        - synthetic sheets, mark layers, colour modes and
      reproducible distortions.
    * ``folds.py``            - a physically folded page corner: local, not
      projective, and therefore not something a homography can undo.
    * ``metrics.py``          - per-bubble fill measurements *(Phase 3)*.

The public entry point is :func:`align_sheet`::

    from omr_scanner.imaging import AlignmentConfig, align_sheet

    result = align_sheet(image=scan, config=config)
    canonical_page = result.normalized_image

What does NOT belong here:
    * Any PySide6/Qt import. This layer must be usable from a headless worker and
      from tests without a display. Converting a result into a ``QImage`` for
      display is the GUI layer's job.
    * Interpretation of measurements ("this is the digit 7"); that is
      ``recognition``.
    * File system layout knowledge, project structure or database access.
      Reading a scan from disk and building an
      :class:`~omr_scanner.imaging.config.AlignmentConfig` from a template are
      both :mod:`omr_scanner.services.alignment_service`.

Contract:
    * Functions take and return NumPy arrays plus plain data types; they never
      take an :class:`~omr_scanner.domain.template.OmrTemplate`, so they stay
      unit-testable with synthetic images.
    * Coordinates follow the convention in
      :mod:`omr_scanner.domain.geometry`: origin top-left, ``y`` downward, and
      four-corner sequences are always TL, TR, BR, BL.
    * The caller's image is never modified.
    * Failures raise a subclass of :class:`omr_scanner.errors.ImagingError`
      carrying a stable ``code``; nothing returns ``None`` to mean failure.

Specification:
    ``docs/IMAGE_PROCESSING.md`` describes the algorithm, its failure modes and
    its measured accuracy, and must be updated together with this package.
