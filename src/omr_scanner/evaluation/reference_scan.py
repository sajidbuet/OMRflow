"""A real blank form, registered once, so synthetic marks can be laid on it.

Purpose:
    Make it possible to generate a labelled dataset whose *paper is real*. The
    template-rendered mode draws the whole page by arithmetic, which is honest
    about its own limits - clean geometry, even paper, marks made of ellipses -
    and those limits are exactly the ones a recognition threshold most needs
    testing against. This module removes them from everything except the marks:
    the page, the print, the paper texture, the scanner's own noise and the
    illumination all come from a photograph of a genuine blank sheet, and only
    the candidate's ink is synthesised.

Responsibilities:
    * :func:`load_reference_scan` - decode a blank scan, register it against the
      template, and refuse it with a readable reason if it will not register.
    * :func:`render_onto_reference` - warp a mark layer into that scan's own
      pixels and composite it.

What does NOT belong here:
    * A second registration algorithm. Registration is
      :func:`omr_scanner.imaging.align_sheet`, unchanged, configured from the
      template by
      :func:`~omr_scanner.services.alignment_service.alignment_config_from_template`
      - the same call the production Scan stage makes. A generator that
      registered pages its own way could produce a dataset the engine cannot
      read for reasons that are the generator's fault, and nobody would be able
      to tell which.
    * Anything about marks, answers or ground truth. This module is handed a
      finished ink layer and asked where to put it.

Which direction the transform goes, since it is the thing most easily got
backwards:
    :func:`~omr_scanner.imaging.align_sheet` returns ``transform_matrix``,
    which maps **scan pixels onto the canonical page** - that is what
    rectification needs. Generation wants the opposite: it holds marks in
    canonical coordinates and needs them in the scan's. That is
    ``inverse_transform_matrix``, and it is the only one this module uses.

An accidental but welcome property:
    Because the transform comes from a full alignment rather than from four
    raw corner positions, a reference scan that was fed upside down or a
    quarter turn askew is registered correctly - the orientation mark resolves
    it - and the marks still land in the right bubbles. A crooked, rotated or
    perspective-distorted blank scan is a usable reference, not a rejected one.

Resolution policy, stated because it is a real decision and not an oversight:
    The produced image is the reference scan **at its own native resolution**.
    A ``--dpi`` setting describes rendering a page from its physical size in
    millimetres and has no meaning here: the pixels already exist and were
    produced by a real scanner at whatever resolution it was set to. The mark
    layer is therefore rendered at an integer multiple of the template's
    canonical size, chosen so that it is at least as dense as the scan it is
    about to be warped into (:data:`MAX_MARK_LAYER_SCALE` caps it), and marks
    come out as sharp as the paper underneath them rather than upscaled from a
    smaller page.
