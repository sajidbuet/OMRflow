"""Named synthetic test cases, planned from a template.

Purpose:
    Decide *what each generated sheet is a test of* - a blank identifier
    column, two marks on one question, a five-degree rotation, a damaged
    corner marker - and say so in a tag that survives all the way into the
    benchmark's category table. "97.9% correct" is not actionable; "ticks
    89/100, perspective 84/100, everything else perfect" is.

Responsibilities:
    * :class:`TestCaseTag` - the vocabulary of what can be tested.
    * :class:`FieldLayout` - what *this* template actually offers, so a
      generator never hard-codes seven digits or four options.
    * :class:`SheetCase` - one sheet's full definition: the marks to draw, the
      degradation to apply, the truth to record, and the tags it carries.
    * :class:`SheetBuilder` - states a mark once and derives the truth from it.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Choosing which cases a dataset contains, which is
      :mod:`omr_scanner.evaluation.case_plans`.
    * Drawing and file I/O, which are
      :mod:`omr_scanner.evaluation.synthetic_dataset`.
    * Recognition, or any opinion about it.

Why ground truth is *derived* from the marks:
    Every expected value on a case is computed from the marks the case will
    draw, by one rule, in one place. A generator that decided "this sheet
    answers B" separately from "draw a mark on B" will eventually disagree
    with itself, and the benchmark will blame the engine. This has already
    happened once in this repository (double marks were labelled in the order
    they were drawn rather than printed order), which is why the two are no
    longer allowed to be stated twice.

Mandatory before random:
    A profile's interesting cases are emitted first and unconditionally. If
    twenty sheets are asked for and the profile has thirty edge cases, the
    first twenty are edge cases - never a random sample that happens to omit
    the blank-identifier test.
