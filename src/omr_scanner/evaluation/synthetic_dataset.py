"""Rendering a planned dataset: images, ground truth and a manifest.

Purpose:
    Take the case plan
    (:mod:`omr_scanner.evaluation.case_plans`) and turn it into files on disk:
    a scan-like image per sheet at a realistic resolution, a ground-truth
    document beside it, and a manifest that makes the whole thing
    reproducible.

Responsibilities:
    * :func:`sheet_spec_from_template` - project a real ``.omrt`` template onto
      a renderable page.
    * :func:`render_case` - one planned case to one image plus its truth.
    * :func:`generate_dataset` - the whole dataset, with progress and
      cancellation.

What does NOT belong here:
    * Deciding *what* to test - that is `case_plans`, and keeping the two
      apart is what stops the renderer from quietly drawing whatever the
      engine happens to read.
    * Recognition, or any judgement about it
      (:mod:`omr_scanner.evaluation.benchmark`).

Why the template drives everything:
    Page size, markers, orientation mark, zone geometry and bubble grids all
    come from the selected template, so a dataset exercises the coordinate
    mapping the engine really uses:

    ```text
        one template definition
                 │
          ┌──────┴──────┐
          ▼             ▼
    real scanning   synthetic generation
          └──────┬──────┘
                 ▼
        the same recognition geometry
    ```

    A generator with its own idea of where bubbles go would test the two
    halves of the application against each other's mistakes.

Two rendering modes:
    :class:`RenderMode` decides where the *page* comes from. The marks, the
    answers and every piece of ground truth are decided identically either way,
    before anything is drawn, which is the property that makes the two modes'
    results comparable:

    ```text
        case plan  (answers, identifier, set code, degradation)
              │
      ┌───────┴────────┐
      ▼                ▼
    TEMPLATE      REFERENCE_SCAN
    draw the      draw only the marks and
    whole page    lay them on a real blank scan
      └───────┬────────┘
              ▼
        the same ground truth
    ```

Resolution:
    In :attr:`RenderMode.TEMPLATE`, sheets are rendered at :data:`DEFAULT_DPI`
    from the template's *physical* page size in millimetres, not at its
    canonical pixel size. That is the honest thing to do - a real scan is
    whatever the scanner produced, and rendering at the canonical size would
    hand the engine a page that needed no rescaling and quietly stop testing
    one.

    In :attr:`RenderMode.REFERENCE_SCAN` the pixels already exist, so the DPI
    setting has nothing to act on and is not applied; the output is the
    reference scan at its native resolution. See
    :mod:`omr_scanner.evaluation.reference_scan`.

An honest warning, stated here because it is easy to forget:
    Synthetic accuracy is not real accuracy. In :attr:`RenderMode.TEMPLATE`
    these pages have clean geometry, even paper and marks drawn by arithmetic.
    They measure *regression consistency and controlled edge-case handling*,
    and are nearly useless as evidence that a threshold is right for real
    pencil on real paper.

    :attr:`RenderMode.REFERENCE_SCAN` narrows that gap - the paper, the print,
    the illumination and the scanner's own behaviour are real - but it does not
    close it. The *marks* are still drawn by arithmetic, and a real candidate's
    pencil is not an ellipse. It is better evidence, not sufficient evidence.

    The choice made here is to remove the *claim* along with the defect, rather

    * The tag goes too, so nothing in the dataset says ``MARKER_MISSING`` about
      a sheet whose markers are all present. A benchmark that grouped by that
      tag would otherwise report a category it never actually tested.
    * ``expect_failure`` goes, unless the sheet still carries a reason to fail
      that has nothing to do with markers (:data:`INDEPENDENT_FAILURE_TAGS`).
      Putting a missing marker back makes the sheet readable, and a dataset
      that still expected it to be refused would score a correct reading as an
      error.
    * A note is appended saying what was dropped, so a human reading the ground
      truth of a single sheet can see it happened without going back to the
      manifest.

    Everything else - the marks, the answers, the identifier, the set code, the
    geometric and photometric degradation - is untouched, because all of it
    survives the change of rendering mode intact. That is what keeps the two
    modes' ground truth identical for every sheet that carries no marker
    damage, which is the great majority of them.
